##Hi, I'm Finn!

I'm a passionate software engineer with a knack for building creative mobile appsâ€”from a dynamic card game to a jogging app that syncs your music to your pace. I bring a diverse skill set in Dart/Flutter, Python, Java, C/C++, and web development, coupled with extensive database experience.

Currently, I'm honing my expertise at Airbus and pursuing my Master's in Intelligent Systems at THU Ulm. I have a keen interest in exploring the potential of AI, always seeking the next breakthrough in intelligent technology.

I believe in a minimalistic design aesthetic, favoring dark primary colors accented by bright highlightsâ€”a style that reflects both elegance and modernity.
